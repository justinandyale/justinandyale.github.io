        <h2 id="reasons-title"><s>Why Yale?</s> Why Justin?</h2>
        <ul id="reasons-list">
          <li><i>Biology and the World</i> - I'm one of (what seems like) only a handful of high schoolers interested in studying the growing issue of antibiotic-resistance, which, if left unchecked, may cause more deaths than cancer by 2050. As a student at Yale, I could take advantage of the unique biology track, biotechnology, and prepare myself for my career in researching alternatives to antibiotics.</li>
          <li><i>Liberal Arts Core</i> - My brain speaks biology, but my soul speaks art. At Yale, I plan to puruse my diverse interests in creative writing, art history, and politics as I become a more "broadly informed, and highly disciplined intellect." Perhaps by the end of my four years, Yale will boast yet another young author: I hope to publish a book I've started planning - "The Torturer's Apprentice" - by the time I complete my degree.</li>
          <li><i>Community Engagement</i> - I am a man who lives to serve. At Yale, this means continuing my devotion to teaching high schoolers about computer science by helping to lead clubs such as <i>Code Haven</i> and <i>Code for Good</i>. I would also like to be involved in the <i>Bioethics Society</i> and help solve the growing concerns that follow newer biotechnologies.</li>
